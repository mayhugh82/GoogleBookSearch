## About the Code

### Getting Started

First thing I did was create the React Client-side boilerplate by typing create-react-app clicky-game in the command line. Next, I changed into that directory by typing 'cd clicky-game' in the terminal. After that I typed npm run start to open the app in the browser.

### Starting to Code

Create-react-app gives you a public folder with a basic index.html page, some basic css for the react template, an App.js file, index.js file, and some other boilerplate files. I only had to alter two things in the index.html page: the title of my app and include a Bootstrap CDN link. I either altered or completely changed the rest of the files, adding my own style. The bulk of the code for this app was done in the src/components directory. I decided to make three total components for my app, however, it could have been made with much more or probably less.

### Components

* Card

The card component is where the cartoon images are displayed.

* Score

The score component is where the score is displayed.

* Wrapper

The Wrapper component wraps the card component.
